# Boylar Bangla Browser Extension

Boylar Bangla is a browser extension designed to enhance the browsing experience for Bengali language users by providing real-time English-to-Bengali translations. This project is powered by a Laravel-based backend and the free Google Translate API. 

The backend is hosted at [translate.boylar.com](https://translate.boylar.com), which serves as the core translation engine. To use the extension, users need to install the browser extension on their Chrome browser. Once installed, users can simply select any English text on a webpage, and a tooltip will appear displaying the Bengali translation of the selected word or sentence. 

This seamless integration makes it easier for Bengali speakers to understand English content while browsing the web, offering a smooth and efficient translation experience.
